## Technology

I love to build, repair, and flip computers.  This is a long running hobby of me trying to keep old computer hardware alive and also enjoying the luxury of new hardware to do all the programming I want.   Also I like mechanical keyboards, particularly ones with bucking spring key switches such as my old 1993 IBM Model M or new 10-keyless 2021 Unicomp Model M.

## Volunteering
I have been volunteering a long time and only recently took a break to focus on the tough workload of college.  I have had the honor to receive the President's Volunteer Service Award twice (2017 & 2018).  Virtually all of the volunteering I did was at my local public library and the most prominent one I participated in was homework help which was a weekly event in which I would help student's grades K-6th with homework.

In 2019, I was awarded the South Huntington Public Library Friends of the Library Scholarship in recognition of my continual and frequent community service.

## Cars
I own a 2009 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor.  It has been my gateway into learning how to repair, modify, and enjoy cars beyond their basic utility.  I enjoy performing all the repairs on my own regardless of difficulty - ranging from a basic oil change to changing out my steering column.  Moreover, any car-buff may know that the Crown Victoria is a fun vehicle to hotrod.  My next project car will be a Foxbody Mustang.

## Photography
I love to take photos with my Canon 5D Classic DLSR.  Despite being a 10 year old full frame camera, I am still able to take my camera and take a picture of whatever I would want to.  I love to take photos of my dog, cars (typically classic cars), and whatever landscape I encounter.

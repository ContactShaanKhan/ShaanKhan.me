I love programming and my current favorite languages are Python, C, and Javascript.  Some of my favorite thing's to learn about include operating systems and history.</p> <p>I am particularly proud of my heritage. My mom was born in the Czech Republic and from her I inherited my ability to speak Czech and the ability to stay and my Babi\u010dka's house to eat some amazing food.  My father's parents are Pakistani and have given me a high spice tolerance and deep appreciation of South Asian food.</p> <p>For the last 2 years I have been working at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, first as an intern, and then as a full time Software Developer.  I sit next to, and closely work with, the EMM (Electronic Market Making) traders, the trading platform developers, and key members of various infrastructure teams.  I have many responsibilities, including software develpment (of many different project), performance reporting/monitoring, and managing a lab environment.</p> <p>When I am not dealing with 1s and 0s, I enjoy playing with my dog Shadow and working on various car projects. I drive both a 2009 Crown Victoria p71 and a 1999 Tacoma 5 speed manual.  Recently, I have been reading a lot more and have been enjoying some amazing books.</p>"},{"location":"#header","title":"Hi!

I have had the honor to receive the President's Volunteer Service Award twice (2017 &amp; 2018).  Virtually all of the volunteering I did was at my local public library and the most prominent one I participated in was homework help which was a weekly event in which I would help student's grades K-6th with homework.  In 2019, I was awarded the South Huntington Public Library Friends of the Library Scholarship in recognition of my continual and frequent community service.

This is a long running hobby of me trying to keep old computer hardware alive and also enjoying the luxury of new hardware to do all the programming I want.

It has been my gateway into learning how to repair, modify, and enjoy cars beyond their basic utility.  I enjoy performing all the repairs on my own regardless of difficulty - ranging from a basic oil change to changing out my steering column.  Moreover, any car-buff may know that the Crown Victoria is a fun vehicle to hotrod.  My next project car will be a Foxbody Mustang.</p>"},{"location":"interests/#photography","title":"Photography","text":"<p>I love to take photos with my Canon 5D Classic DLSR.  Despite being a 10 year old full frame camera, I am still able to take my camera and take a picture of whatever I would want to.  I love to take photos of my dog, cars (typically classic cars), and whatever landscape I encounter.</p>"},{"location":"shadow/","title":"Shadow","text":""},{"location":"shadow/#header","title":"Shadow!","text":""}]}

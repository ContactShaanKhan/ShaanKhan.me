I am a Computer Science graduate from Stony Brook University.  I enjoy working with JavaScript whether that be for website development through React or building some backend infrastructure in the cloud.  I also love to learn about operating systems and with that comes a joy of working with C.</p> <p>When I am not dealing with 1s and 0s, I enjoy playing with my dog Shadow, working on my 2009 Crown Victoria Police Interceptor (big things in store), taking photos with my Canon 5D classic, and listening to a vast variety of music including rock (both classic and modern).</p>"},{"location":"#header","title":"Hi!

This is a long running hobby of me trying to keep old computer hardware alive and also enjoying the luxury of new hardware to do all the programming I want.   Also I like mechanical keyboards, particularly ones with bucking spring key switches such as my old 1993 IBM Model M or new 10-keyless 2021 Unicomp Model M.</p>"},{"location":"interests/#volunteering","title":"Volunteering","text":"<p>I have been volunteering a long time and only recently took a break to focus on the tough workload of college.  I have had the honor to receive the President's Volunteer Service Award twice (2017 &amp; 2018).  Virtually all of the volunteering I did was at my local public library and the most prominent one I participated in was homework help which was a weekly event in which I would help student's grades K-6th with homework.</p> <p>In 2019, I was awarded the South Huntington Public Library Friends of the Library Scholarship in recognition of my continual and frequent community service.</p>"},{"location":"interests/#cars","title":"Cars","text":"<p>I own a 2009 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor.  It has been my gateway into learning how to repair, modify, and enjoy cars beyond their basic utility.  I enjoy performing all the repairs on my own regardless of difficulty - ranging from a basic oil change to changing out my steering column.  Moreover, any car-buff may know that the Crown Victoria is a fun vehicle to hotrod.  My next project car will be a Foxbody Mustang.</p>"},{"location":"interests/#photography","title":"Photography","text":"<p>I love to take photos with my Canon 5D Classic DLSR.  Despite being a 10 year old full frame camera, I am still able to take my camera and take a picture of whatever I would want to.  I love to take photos of my dog, cars (typically classic cars), and whatever landscape I encounter.</p>"},{"location":"shadow/","title":"Shadow","text":""},{"location":"shadow/#header","title":"Shadow!","text":""}]}

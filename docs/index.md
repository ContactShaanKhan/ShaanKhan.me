Thank you for visiting my site!

You are probably here for Shadow's page, but in the off chance you're hear to learn about me, welcome!

I'm a Computer Science graduate from Stony Brook University and am currently working at Société Générale as a software developer in application support.
I love programming and my current favorite languages are Python, C, and Javascript.  Some of my favorite thing's to learn about include operating systems and history.

I am particularly proud of my heritage. My mom was born in the Czech Republic and from her I inherited my ability to speak Czech and the ability to stay and my Babička's house to eat some amazing food.  My father's parents are Pakistani and have given me a high spice tolerance and deep appreciation of South Asian food.

For the last 2 years I have been working at Société Générale, first as an intern, and then as a full time Software Developer.  I sit next to, and closely work with, the EMM (Electronic Market Making) traders, the trading platform developers, and key members of various infrastructure teams.  I have many responsibilities, including software develpment (of many different project), performance reporting/monitoring, and managing a lab environment.

When I am not dealing with 1s and 0s, I enjoy playing with my dog Shadow and working on various car projects. I drive both a 2009 Crown Victoria p71 and a 1999 Tacoma 5 speed manual.  Recently, I have been reading a lot more and have been enjoying some amazing books.


<!-- From  job description: The day-to-day responsibilities of the EMM Support team include but are not limited to the following:


    Operate, administer, and extend a 1,000 live servers’ platform, built with state-of-the-art and low latency technologies, connected to more than 40 Trading Venues, and processing from 10 to 30 million orders per day and a vast amount of financial information in real time

## My Achievements

I don't enjoy boasting about myself but there are a few achievements I am particularly proud of.

### Volunteering

I have been volunteering a long time.  I have had the honor to receive the President's Volunteer Service Award twice (2017 & 2018).  Virtually all of the volunteering I did was at my local public library and the most prominent one I participated in was homework help which was a weekly event in which I would help student's grades K-6th with homework.  In 2019, I was awarded the South Huntington Public Library Friends of the Library Scholarship in recognition of my continual and frequent community service.  You can find a copy of the newsletter [here](https://shpl.info/sites/default/files/2019-10/1909_News.pdf).

### Education

I had the pleasure to be the class of 2019 Walt Whitman High School salutatorian out of a class of about 445 students.  Furthermore, I graduated summa cum laude from Stony Brook after making the Dean's list every semester.

## Old Website Iterations

This website has gone through a few different iterations.  The first being a [google site](https://www.old.shaankhan.me), the next being a site with [react](https://react.shaankhan.me), and finally with the current iterations being built with Mkdocs.  Why do I change it so often? I just like to try new things :)
